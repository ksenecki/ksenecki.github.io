# My story

This is me playing with [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/), a framework to create presentations.

## Project requirements

1. [Node 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
2. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/doc) is optional

## How to setup the Project

1. Clone repository
2. Enter the project directory and execute `npm install` in order to install all the packages
3. `yarn` can be used as an alternative

## Reveal.js

This project uses reveal.js. This is an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create beautiful presentations for free. Check out their live demo and tutorial at [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/).

## Development

- start development server using `npm start`
